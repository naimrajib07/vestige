##The basic workflow is as follows:

- Add you feature/fix to GitHub Issues (assuming if does not already exist)
- Fork the repo then clone in to your local machine `git clone git@github.com:your-username/vestige.git`
- Get vestige running on your local machine
- Run the tests (use the `rake` command)
- Create a feature branch
- Make your change or write your feature
- Write tests for your contribution
- Make sure your tests pass
- Run all the test again ensuring nothing broke due to your contribution
- Push your feature branch
- Submit a Pull Request (PR)

At this point you're waiting on us.  We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives. If approved, we will merge your PR into the master branch
